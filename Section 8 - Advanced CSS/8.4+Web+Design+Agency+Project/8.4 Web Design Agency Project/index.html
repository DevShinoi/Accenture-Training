            A War Without Casualties The Republic of San Magnolia has long been
            under attack from the neighboring Giadian Empire's army of unmanned
            drones known as the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the
            Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the
            one-sided struggle into a war without casualties-or at least, that's
            what the government claims. In truth, there is no such thing as a
            bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five
            Republic territories lies the "nonexistent" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The
            young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six
            and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the "unmanned" weapons into
            battle...

            Let’s go back to where we belong Having bid Lena farewell, Shin and
            the surviving members of the Spearhead squadron continue into the
            heart of Legion territory. There, they endure countless hardships
            until they’re rescued by the Federal Republic of Giad, a reformed
            nation that offers them a second chance at a peaceful life. But it
            isn’t long before a sense of duty calls the Eighty-Six back to the
            battlefield. Choosing to enlist in the military, they willingly walk
            back through the gates of hell, this time joined by a peculiar new
            ally-Frederica Rosenfort: a haughty young girl with a rare ability and
            wisdom far beyond her years.

            Pride is all we have. The attack Shin foresaw has finally come to pass.
            Wielding a weapon with destructive force hitherto unseen, the
            Long-Range Artillery-type Legion unit rains unmitigated chaos over the
            battlefield. Both the Federacy’s western front and the Gran Mur of the
            Republic crumble under the might of the monolithic railgun, capable of
            dealing catastrophic damage from hundreds of kilometers away. With
            their backs against the wall, the Giadian military makes a
            controversial decision: A special strike force will charge into the
            heart of Legion territory, engage the Railgun type from close range,
            and destroy it. Shin and the Eighty-Six will spearhead the operation.
            …But Shin has not been himself lately. Having defeated his brother’s
            ghost and freed himself from the Republic, the Reaper finds himself
            without purpose. What reason does he have to go on living? For whose
            sake does he fight…?

            OLD FRIENDS, NEW ENEMIES Against all odds, Shin and the Eighty-Six have emerged victorious from their battle with the Morpho, liberating scores of surviving Republic promise and finally caught up to the Spearhead squadron. And while her citizens from the Legion’s dark agenda. Lena, in turn, has fulfilled her presence has brought out a softer side in Shin, it seems to have roused to an end when the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, with Lena at the helm, the competitive spirits within Kurena and Frederica. But the fun comes in the Republic’s northern secondary capital, Charité. Deep underground, receives its first mission. Their destination: an abandoned subway tunnel the gaping maw of a subterranean Legion base awaits them...
